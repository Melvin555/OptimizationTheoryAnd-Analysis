# OptimizationTheoryAndAnalysis
Here is a collection of code for Optimization Theory Materials

The code is mainly a sample for showing how the inexact line search works
As known, line search can be differentiated into two types:
1) exact line search -> Simultaneous line search (i.e. The Golden Section Method, The Fibonnacci Method, and The Bisecting Search Method); and Sequential line search (i.e. The Newton's method, Secant method, and Parabola method)
2) inexact line search -> Armijo stepsize rule, Goldsten stepsize rule, Wolfe stepsize rule

These sample codes are created to show how inexact line seach algorithms work
